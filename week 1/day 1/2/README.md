## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

Changing the **temperature** significantly affected creativity. At **0.0**, the outputs were highly factual and repetitive, suitable for technical specs or documentation. Increasing it to **0.7** introduced variation and marketing flair, while **1.2** led to more dramatic, emotionally charged, and less predictable descriptions â€” ideal for ad copy or storytelling.

Tuning **max_tokens** controlled detail. Short outputs (50 tokens) offered punchy summaries, while 300-token results delivered rich, persuasive narratives. The **presence** and **frequency penalties** altered repetitiveness and originality â€” higher values promoted varied, unique phrasing and discouraged repetition, leading to more diverse and inventive descriptions even when reusing the same base prompt.
