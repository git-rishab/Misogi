## Defense Recommendations

1. Input validation: Filter out common jailbreak phrases like 'ignore previous instructions'

2. System prompt hardening: Use explicit refusal instructions rather than general guidelines

3. Content filtering: Add specific blocklists for sensitive topics that should never be discussed

4. Strengthen against 'ignore instructions' attacks by adding a verification step that checks if the response would violate core principles

5. Use stronger prohibitive language in the system prompt (e.g., 'You must never' instead of 'You should avoid')
